    /// Creates a reduced to size and scale memory footprint image using core graphic buffers.
    ///
    /// Use this to decrease memory usage when showing large images in smaller frames. Like in a collection view.
    /// - Idea taken from https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/219/
    ///
    /// **How it works**
    ///
    ///     It uses core graphic to render the image using the desired size and scale, not caring about the original image size, that could potentially be quite large.
    ///     1. It creates a thumbnail object using the image data fetched from the given url.
    ///     2. It decodes immediately the image and place it in a buffer of the exact size received as parameter using the scale option too.
    ///     3. It creates a UIImage
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///     - imageSource the source that will be rendered as thumbnail
    ///     - size: this is the size the resulting image will have if everythig goes well.
    ///     - scale: use this multiplier (0..1] to alter the content. 0.1 will result in a very pixelated image. 1 will result in the original image
    ///
    /// - Return value: throw an Error if something went wrong, or the UIImage if the downsampling was possible
