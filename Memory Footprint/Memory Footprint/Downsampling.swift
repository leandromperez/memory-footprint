/// Creates a reduced to size and scale memory footprint image using core graphic buffers.
///
/// Use this to decrease memory usage when showing large images in smaller frames. Like in a collection view.
/// - Idea taken from https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/219/
///
/// **How it works**
///
///     It uses core graphic to render the image using the desired size and scale, not caring about the original image size, that could potentially be quite large.
///     1. It creates a thumbnail object using the image data fetched from the given url.
///     2. It decodes immediately the image and place it in a buffer of the exact size received as parameter using the scale option too.
///     3. It creates a UIImage
///
/// - Parameters:
///
///     - imageData: it will be converted to CFData using UInt8 byte representation in an unsafe pointer
///     - frameSize: this is the size the resulting image will have if everythig goes well.
///     - scale: use this multiplier (0..1] to alter the content. 0.1 will result in a very pixelated image. 1 will result in the original image
///
/// - Return value: nil if something went wrong, or the UIImage if the downsampling was possible
